This repository contains a series of tools to analyze and download (pull) data from FTP servers.  

Scraper3 is the main class that allows a user to pull all filepaths and accompanying file sizes (in bytes) from the FTP
server. A user must add their host, login (user and pass), and download location in order to scan files. The user must also
uncomment #PART B# if they wish to download the files in addition to simply scanning them.  

Send_To_CSV is a sub-class that allows a user to write the results of an FTP scan to a CSV file.  Currently adding 
implementations to do so directly to a Google Doc. 

The first usage of Python_FTP_Tools was to scrape the carbon data from ftp://cdiac.ornl.gov.  This is a public FTP server 
that serves as an excellent sandbox for FTP-tool testing.
